## Description
I decided to pursue this project because I wanted to learn how to create an e-commerce website from scratch. The project itself is a fake e-commerce website meant to replicate the functionality of popular e-commerce websites.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Stripe, Elasticsearch
- **Database:** SQLite

## Reflection
### What did I learn?
- Javascript
- React
- Django Rest Framework
- Elasticsearch

### What were some challenges?
Since this project was larger in scale than my previous projects, managing complexity was particularly challenging. Making sure I was thorough with functionality was challenging too, since E-Commerce websites have lots of small details you need to implement.\
\
A specific component of this project that was challenging was implementing unauthenticated user checkout. 

### How would I take this project further?
There are plenty of areas where I could have kept implementing new features; some notable ideas are user reviews, coupon codes, and an admin page (I just used the default django admin page for this project).
